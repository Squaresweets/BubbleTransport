# Bubble Transport

Bubble transport is a transport for [Mirror Networking](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror) that uses [Game Center Matchmaking](https://developer.apple.com/game-center/) to connect players and transfer data

Bubble is still in development and will be releasing soon! ᵔᴥᵔ

Bubble transport was made by [Matthew Collier](https://matthewcollier.co.uk/) and is 100% free to use in every way!

But if it was useful to you, consider checking out [my game](https://matthewcollier.co.uk/in-the-slimelight/) that I made it for!
